# Fruit-Classification-with-Transfer-Learning
Training a CNN to recognize images of fruits that belong to 120 different classes using transfer learning and data augmentation. Dataset used [Fruit 360](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00580), which was originally shared by y Horea Muresan, Mihai Oltean, Fruit recognition from images using deep learning, Acta Univ. Sapientiae, Informatica Vol. 10, Issue 1, pp. 26-42, 2018.

It contains more than 82,000 images of 120 different types of fruits. A subset of this dataset with more than 16,000 images is used
